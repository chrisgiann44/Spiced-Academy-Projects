database: bucket where we store data. 



two different ways to store data in a database: 

1. tables — they look like tables you would have in Excel. RELATIONAL DATABASE. 
   - Postgres is a relational database. 
   - MySQL is another relational database (but we won't use it in this class)
   - We use a programming language called SQL to talk to databases. 
   - psql — shell / program that runs in our Terminal that's going to allow us to talk to our relational databases through the Terminal 
2. key-value pairs — essentially the data stored would look like a Javascript object. NoSQL DATABASE.
   - Redis is a NoSQL database (we will learn Redis later in the course)
   - Mongodb is a NoSQL database (though we won't use it in this course)

in PSQL (#): SELECT — read data from a table 

in PSQL (#): UPDATE — update a row that already exists in your table
